# restatus

A status page made by resetxd#8278 for his API.

## how to use

To use this page, you need to add the following to your `database/all_links.json`:
```json
{
    "url": [],
    "url2": [],
    "etc...": []
}
```
Then all you need to do is run this on replit or your preferred host, and use uptimerobot so that the replit never sleeps.
